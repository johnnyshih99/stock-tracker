# README

* Ruby version
ruby '2.5.3'
rails 6.1.3.2

* Purpose
Haven't done rails for a while so this is mainly to get familiar and play with rails 6. The focus was on the functionality so there was basically no styling.. yeah I just used tables

* Inspiration
Yahoo finance is lacking the numbers/calculations I want to see at the glance, and I'm too newb of a google sheet user to whip out the table I want without going deep into its functionalities, so I made this.
