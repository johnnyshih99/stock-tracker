# README

* Ruby version  
ruby '2.5.3'  
rails 6.1.3.2  

* Purpose  
Haven't done rails for a while so this is mainly to get familiar and play with rails 6. The focus was on the functionality so there was basically no styling.. yeah I just used tables  

* Inspiration  
Yahoo finance is lacking the numbers I want to see, and excel is hard. Naturally making a web app is easier than figuring out excel =D
